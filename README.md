# Digital Show Program Creator

The Digital Show Program is a Sinatra-based web application prototype for the service I am building, Paperless Playhouse (a non-automated version is already up at www.paperlessplayhouse.com). It allows registered users to create, save, view, and update (or delete) digital programs listing credits for theatrical productions.

The initial screen invites users to sign up or log in with a user name and password. Once logged in, a user is taken to their account page with options to see a list of programs they have created, start a new program, or log out.

1.) Program List

  Displays a list of programs that the user has created. In this view only the title and show dates are displayed, with an option to view the full program. Options are also provided to go back to the main account page or log out.

  Viewing a program shows a formatted version of the show information provided when the draft was created. Below the program draft are options to:

    1.) Edit the program (which brings the user to a similar screen to the initial one for creating the draft, but with form fields pre-populated with the original information. The user can change as many or as few of the fields as they choose.)

    2.) Delete the program (returns the user to their full program list)

    3.) Go back to their full program list.

2.) Draft program

  Takes the user to a form where they are asked to supply a Show Title, Playwright, Show Dates, Production Company, Director, a list of Crew Credits, and Performer Credits. It is possible to submit with any or all of these fields blank, but submitting with no title will result in an automatic title of "Untitled Program" - this and any other field can be updated later.

3.) Log Out

  This option ends the user's session and returns to the home page.
